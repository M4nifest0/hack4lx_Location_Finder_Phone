**********************************************************

# Obtain the target location via the link
</p>

Concept behind hack4lx_Location_Finder_Phone is simple, just like we host phishing pages to get credentials why not host a fake page that requests your location like many popular location based websites.

* Longitude
* Latitude
* Accuracy
* Altitude - Not always available
* Direction - Only available if user is moving
* Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we also get **Device Information** without any permissions :

* Operating System
* Platform
* Number of CPU Cores
* Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
* Screen Resolution
* GPU information
* Browser Name and Version
* Public IP Address
* IP Address Reconnaissance

**This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, hack4lx_Location_Finder_Phone shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.**

## How is this Different from IP GeoLocation

* Other tools and services offer IP Geolocation which is NOT accurate at all and does not give location of the target instead it is the approximate location of the ISP.

* hack4lx_Location_Finder_Phone uses HTML API and gets Location Permission and then grabs Longitude and Latitude using GPS Hardware which is present in the device, so hack4lx_Location_Finder_Phone works best with Smartphones, if the GPS Hardware is not present, such as on a Laptop, hack4lx_Location_Finder_Phone fallbacks to IP Geolocation or it will look for Cached Coordinates.  

* Generally if a user accepts location permsission, Accuracy of the information recieved is **accurate to approximately 30 meters**, Accuracy Depends on the Device.

**Note** : On iPhone due to some reason location accuracy is approximately 65 meters.
